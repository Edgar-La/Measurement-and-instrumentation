## _Obtaining the equation_
In this first step, we need to obtain the __Rth__ equation in __'Vs, R1, R2, R3 & R4'__ terms. Just need to apply algebra. The steps can find [here](https://github.com/Edgar-La/Measurement-and-instrumentation/blob/master/03M1-Estimation_Thevenin_Resistance/Circuit_analysis.pdf).


## _Basic code_
The first code was very basic, it just prints lines of text in the terminal, and the user also type the values in it.
You can see this code [here](https://github.com/Edgar-La/Measurement-and-instrumentation/blob/master/03M1-Estimation_Thevenin_Resistance/0301_simple.py).

I include a capture for the code running.

## _Graphic user interfase code_
In this code I implemented Tkinter, which allows to make a GUI. It includes a diagram for the code and it's more interective.
You can see the code [here](https://github.com/Edgar-La/Measurement-and-instrumentation/blob/master/03M1-Estimation_Thevenin_Resistance/0301_GUI.py).
